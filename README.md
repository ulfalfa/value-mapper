# us-value-mapper

ValueMapper is a class that maps a value to a string based on a mapping table. It supports ranges (1..3) and all kinds of values. I'm using it for translating values coming from my home automation to localized strings. (e.g. a temperature in the range -3 to 3 is "freezy", from 3 to 24 is "warm" and so on...)
